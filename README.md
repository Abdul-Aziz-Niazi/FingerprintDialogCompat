#### FingerprintDialog from Android 28 (P) back ported to Android 23 (M).

## Why do we need this library‚ÅâÔ∏è
- Fingerprint is currently the most secure and most user friendly way of authenticating the user in Android. 
- Android provides different APIs to deal with the fingerprint authentication. These APIs changed overtime. 
    - Android versions below API 23 did not support fingerprint hardware at all.
    - Android versions between API 23 and API 27, uses [`FingerprintManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager.html) for fingerprint authentication. Developer has to manually authenticate by implementing bunch of APIs.
    - Android version above API 28, uses [`FingerprintDialog`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintDialog.html) for fingerprint authentication.
- Due to the Android fragmentation developer has to implement all those APIs based on the android version.üòî It makes managing fingerprint authentication very hard.
- This library aims to simplify fingerprint authentication by providing backport of the `FingerprintDialog` from Android P and provides single public APIs for the authentication all the way to API 14. So as a developer you don't have to deal with the complexity of dealing with different APIs.‚úåÔ∏è

## Features:
- Extremely lightweight üèã.
- Backport of [`FingerprintDialog`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintDialog.html) from Android P, provides same fingerprint authentication on all Android versions.
- Easy to integrate. All you have to do is implement the builder and you are done. The library will take care of authentication based on the device's android version.
- Classifies different error codes provided by the Android framework and wraps them into different error callbacks for easy error handling.

## How to use this library?
- ### Gradle dependency: 
    - Add below dependency into your build.gradle file.
        ```groovy
        implementation 'com.kevalpatel2106:fingerprint-dialog-compat:1.0'
        ```
    - For other build systems see [Import.md](/.github/IMPORT.md).

- ### Prepare the builder.
    - Create the `FingerprintDialogBuilder` and provide the title, subtitle and the description. Application should explain why they need to access user's fingerprint.  
    - ![Dialog](.github/Dialog.png)
    
    #### Java:
    ```java
    final FingerprintDialogBuilder dialogBuilder = new FingerprintDialogBuilder(Activity.this)
        .setTitle(/* Title of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setSubtitle(/* Subtitle of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setDescription(/* Description of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setNegativeButton(/* Negative button of the fingerprint dialog */);
    ```
    
    #### Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    val dialogBuilder = FingerprintDialogBuilder(this)
        .set  Title(/* Title of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setSubtitle(/* Subtitle of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setDescription(/* Description of the fingerprint dialog */)
        .setNegativeButton(/* Negative button of the fingerprint dialog */)
    ```

- ### Implement callbacks and show the dialog.
    - Implement the `AuthenticationCallback` to get callbacks for error or success from the fingerprint authentication dialog.
    
    #### Java:
    ```java
    final AuthenticationCallback callback = new AuthenticationCallback() {
            @Override
            public void fingerprintAuthenticationNotSupported() {
                // Device doesn't support fingerprint authentication. May be device doesn't have fingerprint hardware or device is running on Android below Marshmallow.
                // Switch to alternate authentication method.
            }
    
            @Override
            public void hasNoFingerprintEnrolled() {
                // User has no fingerprint enrolled.
                // Application should redirect the user to the lock screen settings.
                // FingerprintUtils.openSecuritySettings(this)
            }
    
            @Override
            public void onAuthenticationError(final int errorCode, @Nullable final CharSequence errString) {
                // Unrecoverable error. Cannot use fingerprint scanner. Library will stop scanning for the fingerprint after this callback.
                // Switch to alternate authentication method.
            }
    
            @Override
            public void onAuthenticationHelp(final int helpCode, @Nullable final CharSequence helpString) {
                // Authentication process has some warning. such as "Sensor dirty, please clean it."
                // Handle it if you want. Library will continue scanning for the fingerprint after this callback.
            }
    
            @Override
            public void authenticationCanceledByUser() {
                // User canceled the authentication by tapping on the cancel button (which is at the bottom of the dialog).
            }
    
            @Override
            public void onAuthenticationSucceeded() {
                // Authentication success
                // Your user is now authenticated.
            }
    
            @Override
            public void onAuthenticationFailed() {
                // Authentication failed.
                // Library will continue scanning the fingerprint after this callback.
            }
        };
    ```
    
    #### Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    val callback = object : AuthenticationCallback {
    
        override fun fingerprintAuthenticationNotSupported() {
            // Device doesn't support fingerprint authentication. May be device doesn't have fingerprint hardware or device is running on Android below Marshmallow.
            // Switch to alternate authentication method.
        }

        override fun hasNoFingerprintEnrolled() {
            // User has no fingerprint enrolled.
            // Application should redirect the user to the lock screen settings.
            // FingerprintUtils.openSecuritySettings(this@SecureActivity)
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationError(errorCode: Int, errString: CharSequence?) {    
            // Unrecoverable error. Cannot use fingerprint scanner. Library will stop scanning for the fingerprint after this callback.
            // Switch to alternate authentication method.
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationHelp(helpCode: Int, helpString: CharSequence?) {
            // Authentication process has some warning. such as "Sensor dirty, please clean it."
            // Handle it if you want. Library will continue scanning for the fingerprint after this callback.
        }

        override fun authenticationCanceledByUser() {
            // User canceled the authentication by tapping on the cancel button (which is at the bottom of the dialog).
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationSucceeded() {
            // Authentication success
            // Your user is now authenticated.
        }

        override fun onAuthenticationFailed() {
            // Authentication failed.
            // Library will continue scanning the fingerprint after this callback.
        }
    }
    ```
    
    - Show the dialog and start fingerprint authentication.
    
    #### Java: 
    ```java
    dialogBuilder.show(getSupportFragmentanager(), callback);
    ```
    
    #### Kotlin:
    ```kotlin
    dialogBuilder.show(supportFragmentManager, callback)
    ```
